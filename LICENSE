- You do not use this code to discriminate me or other people's projects (Like making the engine a virus or something bad and saying that I was the one that built it)
- If you make any changes to the engine, I would love to see it. This is not a requirement but it is a nice thing to do :)

- Other then that, you can do really whatever you want.
